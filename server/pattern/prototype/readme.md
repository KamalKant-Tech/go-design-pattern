### Prototype Pattern

## What?

# Prototype pattern is design pattern where we copy the existing object rather than creating a new object from scratch.
# This pattern is creatinal design pattern which allows to copy existing objects without making your code dependent on related objects.

## Why?

# Reducing Object Creation Overhead
# Cloning Instead of Creating
# Customization via Cloning
# Cloning objects is typically faster and consumes less memory than creating new objects from scratch. This is because the cloned object already contains the necessary data and has been initialized, avoiding costly setup operations
